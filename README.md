# Electront-test
Some projects of me learning how to use Electron.

### Branch Main
basic structure of an Electron project, for easy reutility.
(Keep in mind the node modules are required in all these)

### Branch PasswordGenerator
A small project with Electron where I developed a program that generates passwords based in a given length.
